#### Title
Mechanical Design Engineer, New Product Development

## Summary

I spent 2 years developing the IPTS sensor from Concept to Launch. The sensor development itself was motivated by the need to simultaneously measure pressure and temperature on a fuel rail in a small M10 threaded package. Pressure temperature sensors are not new to the industry, but measuring the pressure of heated (140C) and pressurized (10bar) gasoline has a significant extra set of safety related requirements that existing products could not meet. The fuel system is subject to CARB requirements which mandate a hermetic sealing requirement through the entirety of its temperature range, a significant departure from typical low pressure sensing technologies available at Sensata.
