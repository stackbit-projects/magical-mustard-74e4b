*Fig. 1: Technical Poster for connector crimp. High loads during assembly left residual stresses that resulted in peculiar deformation, creative solution determined using FEA and validated with simple machined parts. Presented in Regional Conference (Attleboro, MA), North America Conference (Aguascalientes, MX), Global Conference (Attleboro, MA)*
