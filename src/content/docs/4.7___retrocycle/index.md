## Summary

A work in progress, this is my antique motor-bicycle, originally manufactured for the Charles Williams Stores sometime between 1917-1922, the bike was originally built for a small gas engine. I received the bike without wheels, and a skip tooth chain with an odd-sized pitch (1.1"). I added hand fabricated wheels, laced with a direct drive rear hub from ebikekit and a Sturmey-Archer front drum brake, built a front brake sensor out of a hard drive magnet and a hall effect sensor, used old LiPo batteries from Biobot's samplers, and various other parts I had lying around.

Parameters | Value

Max Speed | 28MPH

Acceleration | 0-25MPH, 4s
Max Current | 30A
Max Voltage | 66V

*Fig. 1: Frame was only ~100mm rear spacing, so I stretched it to 135mm to accommodate the modern direct drive hub.*
