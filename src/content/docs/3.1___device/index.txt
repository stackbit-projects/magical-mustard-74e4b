## Summary

Over my 10 months in Biobot the focus on my work was a pumping instrument that pumped wastewater out of a catchment and into the filtration devices. A new development, the product was an exercise in whitesheet design to be the cheapest, most robust, and most flexible design. Through the development process, 6 Design Reviews were held focusing on both technical and user interface needs. The final deliverable was 15 Gamma revision units, and a prototype developed with an IoT, cellular enabled device and successful tests of this device in the field. All technical metrics were hit or exceeded during development including: under consumption of battery life, communication from within a manhole, and precise sampling volumes.
