## Summary

Starting at Biobot the lab was a few stainless benches designed purely for box refreshment. Without any tools to build, I took responsibility of building out a prototyping lab, reminiscent of a makerspace.

*Fig. 2: Rev 3 of the lab, approximately 300 sq. ft. All tables sourced for free, waiting for the right opportunity to snag tables being given away and networking. Additional lighting added to build easier and faster.*
